off and you get a paste. \n Step 2: \n Boil hot water in a separate pot, pour it into the uncooked rice in a bowl. Leave for 5 minutes and wash with cold

your cooked tomato mix and fry for 5 minutes. \n Step 4:\n You will notice that the vegetable oil is coming to the top. Add the tin tomato paste and stir fry some more until the
vegetable oil separates from the tomato paste even more, like in the picture. Add the curry powder, thyme, garlic
powder, seasoning cubes and a bit of salt to taste and mix in properly. Add the bay leaves.* Be mindful of the salt you add, remember your meat stock has salt in it. \n Step 5:\n  mmm by now your kitchen will be filled with the sweet scent of the stew Bring the rice, pour it into the stew pot,
mix together thoroughly and add two cups of meat stock to it. Taste for salt and seasoning, add some more if you
need to and cover the pot with a tight lid.
* The trick to your rice grains coming out nice and singly is cooking with the heat from the meat stock instead of
adding too much water.
* A tight lid pot is highly needed to make the most of the heat within the pot.
* Don’t use a non-stick pot. Use a pot with a heavy base that you can allow to burn.");
