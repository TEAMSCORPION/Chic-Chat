            $botMessage="How to prepare fried rice:
			Ingredients:
4 cups long grain rice (parboiled)
400g fresh shrimps (peeled and deveined)
4 large carrots (cut in stripes)
2 medium size onion (sliced vertically)
1 cup fresh green peas
10 runner beans (sliced diagonally)
3 medium size green bell pepper (sliced vertically, then cut into 1 inch stripes)
3 eggs
1 tbsp. curry
1 tsp. thyme
1 tbsp. butter/margarine
A dash of black pepper
2tbsp garlic powder or 4 cloves (crushed)
Vegetable oil (for frying)
Seasoning cubes
Salt to taste
Instructions
Step 1: Strain the meat stock of your choice cooked meat through a sieve to remove sediments. We need the clear meat stock. I used turkey.
Parboil the rice for 10 minutes and rinse repeatedly with cold water until every hot heat is out. Drain with a sieve to remove water. Proceed to cut the vegetables…I cut my runner beans diagonally. They come out looking better and more artistic in fried rice. Do the same for the carrots. Slice the onions vertically into stripes. Same goes for the green peppers.
Step 2:Place the parboiled rice into a pot over low heat, pour 1 to 1-1/2 cups of meat stock into the rice.
Add the garlic, curry, thyme, seasoning cubes and salt to taste.
Step 3:Mix properly with a wooden spatula and cover with a tight lid. Allow to cook nicely until the stock dries out.
Remove immediately from the pot and spread the rice out on a tray to lose the heat. This prevents clumping. See how lovely the grains are?! 🙂
Step 4:Now, in a small pot, cook the green peas with a little salt and water for 5 minutes, then drain. In a frying pan over heat, add 1 table spoon of vegetable oil, add some salt to the shrimps, mix in nicely and pour it into the pan. Add a dash of black pepper and fry for 5 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk. Place a clean frying pan over heat, add the butter/margarine and pour in the eggs. Whisk continuously with the slotted spoon until the eggs cuddle, forming small islands of cooked eggs. Set aside.
Step 5:In a clean frying pan, pour a cooking spoon of vegetable oil, add the diced vegetables, salt and seasoning cubes and stir fry for 4 minutes. Return the rice on the tray into a clean pot and pour the vegetables into the pot.

* You could chose to divide the rice, shrimps, eggs and vegetables into 4 parts. Then fry in batches with a tablespoon of vegetable oil.
Step 6:Mix in the shrimps, then the green peas. Allow to heat up for 3 minutes.Finish up with the scrambled eggs. Cover the pot and allow the rice to heat up.
Serve with fried turkey/beef/chicken/fish, moin moin and/or salad.
Enjoy!";
